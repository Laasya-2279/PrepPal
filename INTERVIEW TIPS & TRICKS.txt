INTERVIEW TIPS & TRICKS

✅ Before the Interview (Preparation Phase)
Research the company — their mission, products, recent news, and who’s interviewing you (if you know).

Understand the role — read the JD again. Align your answers with the skills they ask for.

Prepare stories using the STAR method. Think: leadership, conflict, success, failure.

Have 2–3 projects ready to speak about in detail — process, challenges, results.

Practice mock interviews out loud — even better, record yourself and cringe now so you don’t cringe later.

Know your resume inside out — don’t get caught off guard by your own content.

Build your “Tell me about yourself” to be crisp, confident, and role-aligned.

Prepare role-specific questions to ask the interviewer — shows curiosity and seriousness.

💬 During the Interview (In-the-Moment Tricks)
First 30 seconds = First impression. Show up calm, confident, and engaged. Sit up straight, smile, and say their name.

Don’t rush to answer — pause > think > speak. Silence shows control.

If you don’t know something? Say:
“I’m not sure, but here’s how I’d approach it…”
(This shows problem-solving, not weakness.)

Use a notepad (if virtual) to jot down multi-part questions.

Don’t undersell soft skills: communication, teamwork, empathy — they matter.

Mention metrics if possible:
“We improved load time by 30%” sounds better than “We made the site faster.”

If you stumble, breathe and recover. Interviews aren’t perfect — real confidence is how you bounce back.

🔁 After the Interview (Follow-up Power Moves)
Send a thank-you email within 24 hours — short, grateful, enthusiastic.
“It was great speaking with you about [role]. I’m really excited about the opportunity.”

Reflect — what went well? What didn’t? Write it down. Learn, adapt, level up.

Don’t obsess. If it doesn’t work out, it wasn’t your room. But you’re building momentum for the right one.

🧠 Power Reminders
Confidence = knowing your value, not having all the answers.

Speak with intention. Every answer is a pitch for YOU.

The interviewer is human. Talk to them, not at them.

They’re not just hiring a skillset — they’re hiring a teammate. Let them feel your presence.

You’re not “lucky to be here.” You earned that seat.
