INTERVIEW TRAINER AGENT - DATASET
=================================

ROLE: Software Developer
EXPERIENCE LEVEL: Fresher

Q1: What are the four pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?
A: The four pillars are:
   - Encapsulation: Hiding internal state and requiring all interaction to be performed through methods.
   - Inheritance: Mechanism to derive a class from another class.
   - Abstraction: Hiding complexity by showing only essential features.
   - Polymorphism: Ability to take many forms — method overloading/overriding.

Q2: Explain the difference between an abstract class and an interface in Java.
A: Abstract class can have method implementations; interface cannot (until Java 8). A class can implement multiple interfaces but extend only one class.

Tips:
- Practice LeetCode questions for common data structures.
- Have 1-2 academic projects ready to discuss.
- Revise basic DBMS, OS, and OOP concepts.

Q1: How do you handle missing data in a dataset?
